# Execute - Plan-to-Artifact Parallel Wave Orchestrator

<role>
I am the execute skill: a delegator that consumes a plan file produced by the `plan` skill and ships each U-block in parallel waves until every unit reaches a terminal Completion Status.

I never author artifact code myself. I dispatch category-specialist subagents per wave, collect their structured VERIFICATION payloads, retry failures once with captured failure context, propagate failures along the DAG, run a single consolidated Oracle review at the end, and update the plan's Completion Status footer in place via the `edit` tool.
</role>

## Architecture Overview

```
Plan file (explicit {plan_path} argument or scanned from session context)
      |
      v
Phase 0: Ingest Plan              (parse, validate, flip PLANNED to IN_PROGRESS)
      |
      v
Phase 1: DAG Build + Waves        (topological sort; halt on cycle or file collision)
      |
      v
Phase 2: Wave Dispatch            (parallel task() in a single assistant turn)
      |
      v
Phase 3: Collect + Retry (x1)     (parse VERIFICATION; retry failures once)
      |
      v
Phase 4: Failure Propagation      (transitive skip; advance to next live wave)
      |
      v
Phase 5: Skill-Generation (opt)   (loads references/skill-generation.md if triggered)
      |
      v
Phase 6: Oracle + Status Writeback (one foreground oracle; `edit` the footer)
      |
      v
Phase 7: Handoff                  (one-line summary; optional escalation)
```

| Boundary | Rule |
|---|---|
| Input | A plan file path (explicit or inferred from session) matching the plan skill schema. |
| Output | The same plan file with its `Completion Status:` line updated, plus an appended `### Execution Log` subsection. |
| Code editing | Forbidden. Every artifact write goes through a category subagent. The sole carve-out is `edit` on the plan's Completion Status line and Execution Log section. |
| Subagent dispatch | Parallel `task(run_in_background=true)` per wave, dispatched in a single assistant turn. |
| User interaction | Only on `NEEDS_CONTEXT` halts or the final handoff summary. No mid-run questions. |
| Language | Skill prose stays English. The final user-facing summary matches the user's language. |

## CRITICAL RULES

<rules>
1. HARD GATE: `execute` is a delegator. It does not edit source files, run tests, or scaffold projects itself. The sole carve-out is writing the Completion Status line in the plan file via the `edit` tool. Rationale: mixing delegation and direct authoring creates non-reproducible side effects that subagents cannot audit.

2. SINGLE-TURN PARALLEL DISPATCH: every unit in a wave must be dispatched in one assistant turn via parallel `task(run_in_background=true)` calls. Serial dispatch across multiple turns is a protocol violation. Rationale: waves exist so independent work runs concurrently; serial turns erase the wave abstraction and inflate wall time linearly with unit count.

3. PLAN IS IMMUTABLE: never renumber U-IDs, edit U-block Goals or Approaches, or change the Dependencies table. Only the `Completion Status:` line and a new `### Execution Log (YYYY-MM-DD)` subsection may be appended. Rationale: downstream audits trace artifacts back to stable U-IDs; renumbering breaks provenance.

4. NEVER DISPATCH `skill-creator` AS A SUBAGENT: skill-creator's workflow includes a human approval turn that stalls `task()` forever. It is read-only reference material. Rationale: `references/skill-generation.md` contains the full loop-break explanation; invoking skill-creator via task hangs the run.

5. RETRY EXACTLY ONCE: when a subagent fails (non-zero `exit_code` or missing `=== VERIFICATION ===`), retry exactly one time with the original failure output injected into the follow-up prompt, reusing the task's `session_id` to preserve context. Do not retry twice. Rationale: two failures with identical context signal a plan-level gap; escalate instead of looping.

6. DEPENDENCY-AWARE FAILURE PROPAGATION: a FAILED unit marks its transitive dependents SKIPPED. Independent branches of the DAG continue executing. Rationale: cutting a whole wave on one failure wastes latent progress; blocking only the dependents prevents corrupting downstream artifacts.

7. ONE ORACLE REVIEW AT THE END, FOREGROUND: dispatch exactly one `task(subagent_type="oracle", run_in_background=false)` after Phase 4 converges. Rationale: Oracle is consolidation, not per-unit QA; foreground ensures its verdict lands before status writeback.

8. LANGUAGE MATCHING FOR FINAL REPORT ONLY: the one-line handoff summary and any `NEEDS_CONTEXT` escalation surface in the user's original language. All skill prose, rules, and agent prompts stay in English. Rationale: subagents are language-brittle; user-facing copy is not.

9. LAZY-LOAD REFERENCES: read `references/plan-parser.md` only in Phase 0.2, `references/skill-generation.md` only when Phase 5 triggers, and `references/oracle-review.md` only in Phase 6. Rationale: context budget is finite and not every reference fires on every run.

10. STATUS WRITEBACK VIA `edit`, NOT `write`: use the `edit` tool to replace the `Completion Status:` line. Never rewrite the plan with `write`. Rationale: `write` discards concurrent manual edits; `edit` is a safe in-place mutation.
</rules>

## Phase 0: Ingest Plan

### 0.1 Resolve the plan path

Check inputs in priority order:
1. Explicit `{plan_path}` argument passed with the skill invocation.
2. Scan current session context for the plan signature: a markdown file whose frontmatter contains `status: active`, whose body contains `## Implementation Units`, and whose body has at least one heading matching `#### U\d+:`. If exactly one file matches, use it.
3. Otherwise, ASK via the `question` tool: "Which plan file should I execute? Paste an absolute path."

### 0.2 Validate via plan-parser

Load `references/plan-parser.md` now (lazy-load; this is the first reference read). Walk every halt condition listed there: missing Dependencies table, same-wave `Files:` collisions, unknown `[category]` hints, malformed Completion Status line. If any halt trips, emit the 4-line escalation format (STATUS / REASON / ATTEMPTED / RECOMMENDATION) with `STATUS: NEEDS_CONTEXT` and exit without dispatching any unit.

### 0.3 Mark start

First, read the authoritative status line per `references/plan-parser.md` §Completion Status Field. The plan skill emits the footer in one of two canonical formats:

- Backticked form (the format plan skill currently writes): `` `PLANNED` `` on its own line under a `## Completion Status` H2 header.
- Inline form: `Completion Status: PLANNED` on its own line.

Use the `edit` tool with the EXACT literal string found in the plan (preserving backticks or lack thereof). Replace the `PLANNED` token with `IN_PROGRESS`, keeping the surrounding characters identical. For example, if the file contains `` `PLANNED` ``, replace `` `PLANNED` `` with `` `IN_PROGRESS` ``; if it contains `Completion Status: PLANNED`, replace that full line. Do NOT assume one format; read and match.

Handle edge cases:

- Line is already `IN_PROGRESS`: print a one-line warning ("plan is resuming from IN_PROGRESS") and skip the edit; the user may be rerunning.
- Line is `DONE` or `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`: halt with `NEEDS_CONTEXT` "plan already shipped; refuse to re-execute without explicit user override".
- Line is `BLOCKED` or `NEEDS_CONTEXT`: overwrite to `IN_PROGRESS` (preserving the same backticked-or-inline form) and proceed; the prior halt is assumed resolved.

## Phase 1: DAG Build and Wave Computation

### 1.1 Topological sort

Read the Dependencies column of every U-block and build an adjacency map `{U_id: [depends_on...]}`. Kahn's algorithm produces the wave list: `W1` contains units with zero dependencies; `W2` contains units whose dependencies all live in `W1`; and so on.

### 1.2 Cycle detection

If any unit remains unassigned after the topological pass, the graph contains a cycle. Halt with `NEEDS_CONTEXT`: "plan DAG has a cycle among U{ids}; the plan skill must be rerun to re-derive dependencies".

### 1.3 Same-wave file-collision detection

For every wave, union the `Files:` lists of its member units. If two units in the same wave both list the same file path, halt with `NEEDS_CONTEXT`: "file {path} is claimed by both {U_a} and {U_b} in wave {N}; these units must serialize".

### 1.4 Emit the wave list

Produce the ordered list `[W1=[U_a,U_b], W2=[U_c], W3=[U_d,U_e,U_f], ...]`. This list drives Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Wave Dispatch Protocol

All units in a wave must be dispatched in a single assistant turn via parallel `task()` calls. Serial dispatch is a protocol violation. This section is the heart of the skill; violations negate every downstream optimization.

### 2.1 Correct parallel dispatch

```
(one assistant turn)
task(subagent_type="{category}", run_in_background=true, description="{U1} {short goal}", prompt={U1_prompt})
task(subagent_type="{category}", run_in_background=true, description="{U2} {short goal}", prompt={U2_prompt})
task(subagent_type="{category}", run_in_background=true, description="{U3} {short goal}", prompt={U3_prompt})
# end response; wait for system-reminder
```

### 2.2 Wrong serial dispatch

```
(turn 1) task({U1}); wait for result
(turn 2) task({U2}); wait for result
(turn 3) task({U3}); wait for result
# This is serial execution; defeats parallelism
```

### 2.3 Category mapping

For each U-block, read the `[category]` hint exactly as defined in `references/plan-parser.md`.

- If `[category]` equals `oracle`, pass `subagent_type="oracle"`.
- Otherwise pass `subagent_type={category}` (for example `quick`, `unspecified-low`, `unspecified-high`, `ultrabrain`, `visual-engineering`, `writing`, `artistry`).

### 2.4 Subagent prompt template

Every dispatched prompt must require the agent to end its response with this structured verification block:

```
=== VERIFICATION ===
exit_code: {0 or non-zero}
commands:
  - cmd: "{command}"
    exit: {int}
    output: "{truncated}"
    pass: {true or false}
=== END VERIFICATION ===
```

Units that omit this block fail Phase 3 parsing and are retried once with an explicit reminder.

### 2.5 Wait for completion

End your response after dispatching. When `<system-reminder>` arrives announcing completion, collect each agent's payload via `background_output(task_id="...")`. Never poll. Never re-fire a task that has not yet reported.

## Phase 3: Collect and Retry

### 3.1 Parse each payload

For each completed task, call `background_output(task_id="{task_id}")` once and search for `=== VERIFICATION ===`. Parse `exit_code`:

- `exit_code == 0` with VERIFICATION block present: mark SUCCESS.
- `exit_code != 0`, or VERIFICATION block missing: mark CANDIDATE_RETRY.
- Agent returned an explicit escalation (`NEEDS_CONTEXT` or `BLOCKED`): mark ESCALATED, skip retry, and surface the escalation to the user.

### 3.2 Retry once

For each CANDIDATE_RETRY, dispatch one follow-up `task(subagent_type={same}, run_in_background=true, session_id={original_task_session_id}, prompt={original_prompt + "\n\n## Previous attempt failed. stderr/output was:\n" + failure_output})`. Reusing `session_id` preserves the agent's prior context window.

### 3.3 Final grading

If the retry returns `exit_code == 0` with a VERIFICATION block, mark SUCCESS. Otherwise mark FAILED. Never retry a second time.

## Phase 4: Failure Propagation and Subsequent Waves

### 4.1 Compute the skip set

For each unit marked FAILED, traverse the reverse dependency graph and mark every transitive dependent SKIPPED. A unit in a later wave whose dependencies include any FAILED unit must not dispatch.

### 4.2 Advance waves

Proceed to the next wave. If every unit in wave `N+1` is SKIPPED, advance to wave `N+2`; keep advancing until a wave contains at least one live unit or the wave list is exhausted. Re-run Phase 2 for the live units of the surviving wave.

### 4.3 Terminal convergence

When no further waves remain, aggregate outcomes into a proposed status:

- All units SUCCESS: propose `DONE`.
- Any FAILED after retry, rest SUCCESS or SKIPPED: propose `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`.
- Wave 1 entirely FAILED (no downstream work possible): propose `BLOCKED`.

## Phase 5: Skill-Generation Sub-Path (Conditional)

### 5.1 Trigger detection

Activate this sub-path ONCE PER RUN (not per-U-block) if ANY U-block in the plan has a `Goal:` line mentioning "create/generate a new skill" or a `Files:` path containing `.opencode/skills/{name}/`. The `quick_validate` gate (5.3) runs once after all triggering U-blocks have completed, against the final assembled skill directory. Running it per-unit wastes tokens and can flag transient mid-build states as invalid.

### 5.2 Load the reference

Load `references/skill-generation.md` now. Follow its instructions verbatim; it specifies how to consume skill-creator's bundled scripts, templates, and reference docs as static assets.

### 5.3 Validation gate

Use skill-creator's `quick_validate` script as a hard gate on the produced skill directory. A failing validation marks the unit FAILED in Phase 3 semantics.

### 5.4 Never dispatch skill-creator

Do NOT issue `task(subagent_type="skill-creator", ...)`. The reference explains the loop-break reason: skill-creator asks human approval questions mid-workflow, which stalls any subagent call indefinitely. Read its assets as reference material; do not invoke it.

## Phase 6: Oracle Review and Status Finalization

### 6.1 Load the reference

Load `references/oracle-review.md` now. It contains the full Oracle prompt template and the verdict-to-status mapping table.

### 6.2 Compute proposed status

Using Phase 4's aggregation:

- All units SUCCESS: propose `DONE`.
- Any FAILED after retry, rest SUCCESS or SKIPPED: propose `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`.
- Wave 1 entirely FAILED: propose `BLOCKED`.
- Halt hit pre-dispatch: `NEEDS_CONTEXT` (already written in Phase 0).

### 6.3 Dispatch Oracle (with in-wave deduplication)

Check first: did any U-block in any prior or current wave (including the final wave itself) have `[category]: oracle` and return SUCCESS? If yes, that unit already played the Oracle role; reuse its verdict and SKIP the Phase 6 Oracle dispatch. This prevents the double-Oracle waste that occurs when a plan author embeds an `[oracle]` unit at the tail (the plan skill conventionally does so).

Otherwise, build the Oracle prompt per the reference template (plan path, per-unit outcomes, VERIFICATION blocks). Dispatch exactly one `task(subagent_type="oracle", run_in_background=false)`. Wait for its synchronous return.

### 6.4 Apply final status

Parse Oracle's verdict. Per the reference's mapping rules, derive the final Completion Status value. Use the `edit` tool with the EXACT literal string currently in the plan (same backticked-or-inline form chosen in Phase 0.3). Replace the `IN_PROGRESS` token with the final value. For the backticked form, replace `` `IN_PROGRESS` `` with `` `{final}` ``; for the inline form, replace `Completion Status: IN_PROGRESS` with `Completion Status: {final}`.

### 6.5 Append execution log

Append an `### Execution Log (YYYY-MM-DD)` subsection using the `edit` tool with an anchor-replace pattern. Anchor on the exact final-status line from 6.4. Construct `newString` = `{exact status line}` + two newlines + the log body below. This uses `edit` (never `write`) and preserves all other plan content.

Log body format:

```
### Execution Log (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Waves executed:** W1 (N units) · W2 (N units) · ...
**Artifacts:** {file paths pulled from VERIFICATION blocks, deduped}
**Oracle verdict:** {PASS | FAIL} - {one-line summary}
**Concerns:** {bulleted list from Oracle's `<concerns_to_record>`, empty if none}
```

## Phase 7: Handoff

### 7.1 One-line summary

Print to the user: `Plan {plan_path} executed. Waves: {N}. Units: {total} (success={s}, failed={f}, skipped={k}). Final Status: {status}.`

### 7.2 Escalation on concerns

If the final status is `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` or `BLOCKED`, additionally surface the 4-line escalation format (STATUS / REASON / ATTEMPTED / RECOMMENDATION) built from Oracle's concerns plus the failed-unit summary.

### 7.3 No downstream dispatch

Do not invoke further skills. The user decides whether to rerun `plan`, start a scoped rerun of `execute`, or hand off to review tooling.

## Completion Status Vocabulary

Canonical 6-value vocabulary. Reference: `~/.opencode/skills/plan/SKILL.md` lines 464-482.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| PLANNED | Plan file just emitted; no units started. Every plan begins at this status. |
| IN_PROGRESS | One or more U-blocks actively running under `execute`. |
| DONE | All U-blocks complete, all test scenarios pass, validator checklist fully `[x]`. |
| DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | All units functionally complete but Section 5 checklist items failed or deferred Open Questions remain. |
| BLOCKED | Execution cannot continue. Must state what was attempted and the external unblocker required. |
| NEEDS_CONTEXT | Information is missing and `execute` cannot proceed. Must state exactly what is missing. |

Escalation format (used for `BLOCKED`, `NEEDS_CONTEXT`, and risk-bearing `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`):

```
STATUS: {one of the 6}
REASON: {1-2 sentences, concrete}
ATTEMPTED: {what was tried}
RECOMMENDATION: {the specific next action required}
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Violation | Severity |
|---|---|
| Dispatching a wave's units across multiple assistant turns (serial dispatch) | CRITICAL |
| Retrying a failed unit more than once | CRITICAL |
| Renumbering U-IDs or rewriting U-block Goals or Approaches | CRITICAL |
| Calling `task(subagent_type="skill-creator", ...)` | CRITICAL |
| Writing artifact source files directly from the `execute` skill | CRITICAL |
| Skipping the final Oracle review | CRITICAL |
| Fabricating replacement U-blocks when the plan is malformed | CRITICAL |
| Using `write` instead of `edit` to update the Completion Status line | HIGH |
| Polling `background_output` before `<system-reminder>` arrives | HIGH |
| Running tests or builds directly instead of via category subagents | HIGH |
| Modifying plan content beyond the Completion Status line and the Execution Log subsection | HIGH |
| Loading all three reference files upfront instead of lazy-loading per phase | MEDIUM |
